I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer and Information Engineering at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen in 2023.

I am affiliated with the [Bayesian Learning for Signal Processing (BLSP) Group](https://blsp-group.github.io/) of CUHK-Shenzhen. My current research interests include, but not limited to:
- Bayesian optimization
- Decision-making under uncertainty
