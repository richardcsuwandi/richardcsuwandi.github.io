<div class="about-content" markdown="1">

I am a **PhD student** at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen. 

I am currently interested in building *robust* and *adaptive* intelligent systems that can learn efficiently from limited data and generalize effectively across diverse tasks. Some of my research topics include:

- **Bayesian optimization** for sample-efficient optimization and sequential decision-making
- **Gaussian processes** for probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty quantification
- **Large language models** for automated algorithm discovery and engineering design
