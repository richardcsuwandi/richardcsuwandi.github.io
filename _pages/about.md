<div class="about-content" markdown="1">

I am a fully-funded **PhD student** at [School of Artificial Intelligence, CUHK-Shenzhen](https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/97) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sai.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/83). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics (with first-class honors) from CUHK-Shenzhen. My current research explores:
- **Bayesian optimization** for sample-efficient black-box optimization and sequential decision-making
- **Gaussian processes** for probabilisitic modeling and uncertainty quantification
- **Foundation models** for open-ended algorithm discovery and generative design in science & engineering
