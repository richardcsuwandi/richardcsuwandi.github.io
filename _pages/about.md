<div class="about-content" markdown="1">
I am a **PhD student** at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en/). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). My current research focuses on:
- **Black-box optimization** with Bayesian optimization and zeroth-order methods
- **Probabilistic machine learning**, especially Gaussian processes and Bayesian inference
- **Large language models** for automated scientific discovery and engineering design
