I am a PhD student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en/). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). My current research interests include:
- **Probabilistic machine learning**, especially Gaussian processes
- **Decision-making under uncertainty** with Bayesian optimization
- **Generative AI**, including large language models and diffusion models
