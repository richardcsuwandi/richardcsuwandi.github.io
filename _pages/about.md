I am a <span class="highlight-text">PhD student</span> at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en/). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BSc degree in Statistics from CUHK-Shenzhen.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/tsunghuichang). My current research focuses on:
- <span class="highlight-text">Black-box optimization</span> with Bayesian optimization
- <span class="highlight-text">Probabilistic machine learning</span>, especially Gaussian processes
- <span class="highlight-text">Generative models</span> for representation learning
